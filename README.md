# Super simple code just to show I can still code something at least.

I will try to add new ip manupulation functions later on with  packet sniffers/analyzers.

Use this to install packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the program:
```
py IpManipulation.py
```
follow the prompt messages.
